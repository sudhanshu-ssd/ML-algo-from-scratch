# ML Algorithms from Scratch (NumPy)

Implementations of core machine learning algorithms using NumPy only,

IMPLEMENTED ALGORITHMNS:

1.Decision tress and Random forest
2.linear regression
3.logistic regression
4.naives bayes
5.PCA
6.softmax regression

These implementations were created as learning exercises and are not
intended as production-ready libraries.
